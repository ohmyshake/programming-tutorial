    "Because of the existence of `Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)`, multi-threads code in multi-cores system can only run one thread at a time. Each thread needs to `acquire` a lock before it can run, and after the thread finishes running, the lock is `released`, and another thread acquires the lock again. So multiple threading is sutiable for `IO bound` mission, not the `CPU bound` mission\n",

    "A `thread pool` maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for `concurrent` execution by the supervising program. By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks. The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available to the program, such as a parallel task queue after completion of execution.\n",

    "One benefit of a thread pool over creating a new thread for each task is that **thread creation and destruction overhead is restricted to the initial creation of the pool**, which may result in better performance and better system stability. Creating and destroying a thread and its associated resources can be an expensive process in terms of time. An excessive number of threads in reserve, however, wastes memory, and context-switching between the runnable threads invokes performance penalties.\n",

    "4. Use the `cancel` method to cancel the submitted task. If the task is already running in the thread pool, it cannot be canceled. In this example, the thread pool size is set to 0.2 and the task is already running, so the cancellation fails. If the size of the thread pool is changed to 0.1, then task1 is submitted first, and task2 is still waiting in line. At this time, it can be successfully canceled.\n",

    "The `wait` method receives 3 parameters, the `waiting task sequence`, the `timeout time` and the `waiting condition`. The wait condition `return_when` defaults to `ALL_COMPLETED`, indicating that all tasks are to be completed. You can see that in the running results, all tasks are indeed completed, and the main thread prints out main. The waiting condition can also be set to `FIRST_COMPLETED`, indicating that the first task is completed and the wait is stopped."

Usually, when a browser sends a request, it will carry an `Accept-Encoding` header field, which contains a list of compression formats supported by the browser, such as `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, etc., so that the server can choose one of them. The compression algorithm is put into the `Content-Encoding` response header, and the original data is compressed and sent to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Chunked` transfer is to disassemble a large file, break it into multiple small blocks, and distribute these small blocks to the browser in batches, and the browser will assemble and restore them after receiving them. In this way, the browser and the server do not need to store all the files in the memory, only send and receive a small part each time, the network will not be occupied by large files for a long time, and resources such as memory and bandwidth are also saved. `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` are mutually exclusive, and these two fields cannot appear in the response message at the same time, and the transmission of a response message is either of known length or unknown length (chunked), this must be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Range Requests` allow the client to use a dedicated field in the request header to indicate that only a part of the file is fetched. The header must include `Accept-Ranges: bytes`.\n",
